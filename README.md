# Zero-day vulnerability 

### What is a zero-day vulnerability?
A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability in a system or device that has been disclosed but is not yet patched. An exploit that attacks a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit

Because they were discovered before security researchers and software developers became aware of them—and before they can issue a patch—zero-day vulnerabilities pose a higher risk to users for the following reasons:

* Cybercriminals race to exploit these vulnerabilities to cash in on their schemes
Vulnerable systems are exposed until a patch is issued by the vendor.
* Zero-day vulnerabilities are typically involved in targeted attacks; however, many campaigns still use old vulnerabilities.

In 2023, Google observed 97 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in-the-wild. That’s over 50% more than in 2022, but still shy of 2021’s record of 106. Google published its fifth annual review of zero-days exploited in-the-wild, marking the first time Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant teamed up on the report.

In the report, “We’re All in this Together: A Year in Review of Zero-Days Exploited In-the-Wild in 2023,” we’re taking a broader look at this space with recommendations for others. TAG and Mandiant combined their expertise to analyze zero-days that were actively exploited against both end-user platforms and products (e.g. mobile devices, operating systems, browsers, and other applications) and enterprise-focused technologies such as security software and appliances.

The result, we hope, is not only a broader assessment but clear guidance for others committed to securing the digital world.

When we analyze the data, we see progress in the fight against zero-days. End user platform vendors, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have made notable investments that are having a clear impact on the types — and number — of zero-days that actors are able to exploit. Vulnerabilities that were commonplace in years past are virtually non-existent today.

On the enterprise side, we see a wider variety of vendors and products targeted, and an increase in enterprise-specific technologies being exploited. Over the years we’ve learned that the quicker we discover and patch attackers’ bugs, the shorter the lifespan of the exploit, and the more it costs attackers to maintain their capabilities. As an industry, we must now learn how to take those lessons and apply them to the wider ecosystem of vendors that are now finding themselves under attack.
