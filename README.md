# Zero-day vulnerability

### What is a zero-day vulnerability?
A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability in a system or device that has been disclosed but is not yet patched. An exploit that attacks a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day exploit

Because they were discovered before security researchers and software developers became aware of them—and before they can issue a patch—zero-day vulnerabilities pose a higher risk to users for the following reasons:

* Cybercriminals race to exploit these vulnerabilities to cash in on their schemes
Vulnerable systems are exposed until a patch is issued by the vendor.
* Zero-day vulnerabilities are typically involved in targeted attacks; however, many campaigns still use old vulnerabilities.
